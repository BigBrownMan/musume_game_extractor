# musume_game_extractor
This is mostly a little project to archive the arts and assets of the webgame of Monster musume which is this one:
https://g123.jp/game/monmusu?lang=en

This project does **not** contain the assets themselves. You need to execute the code to get them.

Things to work on:

- Find a way to combine the assets to create the animations found in the game
- Find a way to download the assets corretly since the URL format can be quite weird. Right now it only download the first couple of girls/allies correctly
