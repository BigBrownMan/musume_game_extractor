# musume_game_extractor
This is mostly a little project to archive the arts and assets of the webgame of Monster musume which is this one:
https://g123.jp/game/monmusu?lang=en

This project does **not** contain the assets themselves. You need to execute the code to get them.

Things to work on:

- Find a way to combine the assets to create the animations found in the game

After looking around the Monster Musume discord, found a tutorial:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V8drIJnqG4tUI5tQIvBhh39wNtadMxcFiLuNrqRkFgw/edit?tab=t.0

Can add a step in the download that make step 2 automatically. For the rest though, will be hard to do that automatically.....

From looking around gamedev reddit, seems to be using Cocos2d for the engine:
https://www.cocos.com/en

Which is a opensource game engine with a game engine UI. Found a page for Atlas:
https://docs.cocos.com/creator/2.4/manual/en/asset-workflow/atlas.html

## Executing the code

- You will need to install Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Download the main.py file found in this repo
- Open a terminal in Windows or Linux
- go to the folder you downloaded main.py
- Run the following command: python3 main.py
