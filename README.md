# musume_game_extractor
This is mostly a little project to archive the arts and assets of the webgame of Monster musume which is this one:
https://g123.jp/game/monmusu?lang=en

This project does **not** contain the assets themselves. You need to execute the code to get them.

Things to work on:

- Find a way to combine the assets to create the animations found in the game


## Executing the code

- You will need to install Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Download the main.py file found in this repo
- Open a termina in Windows or Linux
- go to the folder you downloaded main.py
- Run the following command: python3 main.py
